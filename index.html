    Hi everyone, my name is Masudul Quraishi. 
    I was born and spent most of my life so far in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
    I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Arizona State University. 
    I am working as a research assistant at the Parallel Systems and Computing Laboratory (PSCLab) with Professor Fengbo Ren. 
    My current research area is focused on the virtualization of FPGA devices for high-performance computing. I love to travel, hike, and cook during my free time.
